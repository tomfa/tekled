Exam quiz for subject TIÃ˜4258 Teknologiledelse @ [NTNU](http://www.ntnu.no/).

Built using old exams, [a small python-script](https://github.com/tomfa/exam-interpreter) and with a tiny dash of [Bootstrap](getbootstrap.com/).

Can be seen live at [webutvikling.org/tekled](http://webutvikling.org/tekled)

## How do I add new exams?

Take a look at [this pull request](https://github.com/tomfa/tekled/pull/1/files).

1. Get the questions and alternatives into data.js. ([This](https://github.com/tomfa/exam-interpreter) might help you parse questions from text to JSON format)
2. Add images if you have any to img/

The rest should work by itself.
